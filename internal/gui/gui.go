// Package gui bootstraps the Dear ImGui user interface on top of raylib.
//
// raylib owns the window, the OpenGL context and the input queue; Dear ImGui
// draws through it using the raylib backend that ships with cimgui-go. Two
// windowing stacks cannot share one process, so this arrangement is what lets
// the models be drawn with raylib and pdx-asset-go's shaders while the
// interface is built from a full featured widget toolkit.
//
// Everything in this package runs on the goroutine that created the window:
// raylib and Dear ImGui are both single threaded.
