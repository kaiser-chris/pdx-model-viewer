.SYNOPSIS
Packs the Windows build into an MSIX package for the Microsoft Store.

.DESCRIPTION
Builds the release executable, lays it out with the manifest and the tile
images of this folder, indexes the images with makepri and packs everything
with makeappx. Both tools come with the Windows SDK. The package is not signed:
the Store signs what it publishes.

The version comes from internal/app/version.go, which the release workflow
writes, so running this on a release commit packs that release.

Needs Go and a MinGW gcc on PATH, like any other Windows build.

.EXAMPLE
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File packaging\msix\build-msix.ps1
#>
param(
    # The version to pack, such as 2.0.0. Read from the code when left out.
    [string] $Version,

    # Where the package is written, relative to the repository.
    [string] $Output = "bin\msix"
